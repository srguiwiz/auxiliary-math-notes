<h1>Auxiliary Math Notes</h1>

<p>Notes helping in keeping an engineering tradition â€“ about what one guy
used to know who knew how to make stuff and theory.</p>

<p>We use this. It is auxiliary because there is more basic stuff you probably
need to know, and there is more complex stuff. We are still writing it down as
a memory aid and to exercise the mind. And it was relevant to the work that guy
did.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
